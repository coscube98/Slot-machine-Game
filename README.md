# Casino-Slot-machine-Game
This Python script emulates a 3x3 slot machine, featuring symbols with unique bet multipliers. Players deposit, select lines to bet on, and spin. Winning combinations on chosen lines are assessed, and winnings calculated based on symbol values and bets. The game persists until the player opts to quit, revealing their final balance.
